                <h3>Intent</h3>
                <p>The goal of this project was to envision and create a new way for Finalsite site visitors to find more information about the products and services that the company provides. The listing of products and services needed to be categorized and well organized. A feature must exist to select the services of interest and be able to request a quote, with the option to include an accompanying message.</p>

                <h3>Role</h3>
                <p>Prior to becoming a full time employee with Finalsite, a leading provider of cutting-edge web solutions for private and independent schools, I was contracted as a UX design freelancer to assist on this project.</p>

        <h3>Process</h3>
        <p>We created a series of prototypes starting with lower-fidelity paper prototypes. Through a series of revisions we moved into higher fidelity prototypes created in Photoshop that eventually became finalized artwork for the new component.</p>
