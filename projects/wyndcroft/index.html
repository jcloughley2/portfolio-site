            <h1>The Wyndcroft School</h1>

                <h3>Intent</h3>
                <p>The Wyndcroft School came to Finalsite for the creation of a new website to fulfill their marketing needs and to facilitate communication with students, families, and alumni.</p>
            </div>
            <div>
                <h3>Role</h3>
                <p>While a Finalsite employee, I contributed to the creation of this new responsive website as the lead web designer and lead web developer on the project. Finalsite is a leading provider of cutting-edge web solutions for private and independent schools.</p>

        <h3>Process</h3>
        <div class="layout-treatment half-width">
            <div>
                <h4>Information Gathering</h4>
                <p>A survey was shared with the school to discuss their golas and vision for a new website. The survey dived into school branding and current marketing strategy. As designer on the project, this information was reviewed and an initial call was held with the client to further discuss the goals, structure, and look-and-feel of the new site.</p>
            </div>
            <div>
                <h4>Design</h4>
                <p>The design for this site was created in conjunction with the actual site build-out rather than using Photoshop or Sketch to creat mock-ups that get passed off to a front-end developer ot implement. Doing these two phases of the site creation together saved the team a significant amount of time and allowed us to explore animation and interaction design earlier in the process.</p>
                <p>The design went through a series of revisions with the client until approval was received. Iterations were presented using prototyping and mockup tool Invision. During the design and build out phase, a project manager and I were in contact with the client to ensure a fantastic final product.</p>
            </div>
        </div>
        <h4>Build-Out</h4>
        <p>The new responsive website was built upon Finalsiteâ€™s Composer platform. Front-end development work made use of Git versioning control, Gulp JavaScript task runner, JS/JQuery, Sass, and a variety of JQuery plugins.</p>
