                <h3>Intent</h3>
                <p>Prestonwood Christian Academy came to Finalsite for the creation of a new website to fulfill their marketing needs and to facilitate communication with students, families, and alumni.</p>

            <div>
                <h3>Role</h3>
                <p>While a Finalsite employee, I contributed to the creation of this new responsive website as the lead web developer on the project. Finalsite is a leading provider of cutting-edge web solutions for private and independent schools.</p>

            </div>
        </div>
        <h3>Build-Out</h3>
        <p>Once the design was finalized, the new responsive website was built upon Finalsite’s Composer platform. Front-end development work made use of Git versioning control, Gulp JavaScript task runner, JS/JQuery, Sass, and a variety of JQuery plugins.</p>
