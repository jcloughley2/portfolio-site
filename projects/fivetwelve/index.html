            <h3>Process</h3>
            <div>
            <h4>Research and Design</h4>
                <p>Prior to begining the design of this site, a survey was provided to the stakeholders to identify the goals of their new site. Additionaly, I spoke with them to establish a site-map, the look and feel of the site and to understand how the new site would be managed goign forward. </p>
                <p>Photoshop was used to create desktop and mobile views for the homepage, interior pages and example custom elements and buttons.</p>
                <p>The design went through a series of revisions with the client until approval was received. Iterations were presented using prototyping and mockup tool Invision.</p>
            </div>
            <div>
                <h4>Build-Out</h4>
                <p>Once the design was finalized, the new responsive website was built using Wordpress. I created a custom Wordpress theme for the site. I made use of Git versioning control, the Gulp JavaScript task runner, JS/JQuery, Sass, and a variety of JQuery  and Wordpress plugins.</p>
