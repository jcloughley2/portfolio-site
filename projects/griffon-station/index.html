                <h3>Intent</h3>
                <p>Griffon Station is a new housing development project in an up-and-coming area of Baltimore, MD. The developers were in need of a website to showcase the neighborhood and attract interested home buyers.</p>

                <h3>Role</h3>
                <p>I contributed to the creation of this new responsive website as the lead web developer on the project.</p>

            </div>
        </div>
        <h3>Build-Out</h3>
        <p>Once the design was finalized, the new responsive website was built upon Wordpress. I created a new Wordpress theme and made use of JS/JQuery, Sass, and a variety of JQuery plugins and Wordpress plugins. The site features multiple sliders, photo gallerys, a Google Maps integration, paced animation, a contact form and more.</p>
