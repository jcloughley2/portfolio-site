                <h3>Intent</h3>
                <p>Rye Country Day School came to Finalsite for the creation of a new website to fulfill their marketing needs and to facilitate communication with students, families, and alumni.</p>

                <h3>Role</h3>
                <p>While a Finalsite employee, I contributed to the creation of this new responsive website as the lead web designer and lead web developer on the project. Finalsite is a leading provider of cutting-edge web solutions for private and independent schools.</p>

        </div>
        <h3>Process</h3>
        <h4>Information Gathering</h4>
        <p>A survey was shared with the school to discuss their golas and vision for a new website. The survey dived into school branding and current marketing strategy. As designer on the project, this information was reviewed and an initial call was held with the client to further discuss the goals, structure, and look-and-feel of the new site.</p>
        <h4>Design</h4>
        <p>For the design, Photoshop was used to create desktop and mobile views for the homepage, an example internal page containing elements  and special treatments for landing pages, photo galleries and newsreels.</p>
        <p>The design went through a series of revisions with the client until approval was received. Iterations were presented using prototyping and mockup tool Invision. During the design and build out phase, a project manager and I were in contact with the client to ensure a fantastic final product.</p>

        </div>  
        <h4>Build-Out</h4>
            <p>Once the design was finalized, the new responsive website was built upon Finalsiteâ€™s Composer platform. Front-end development work made use of Git versioning control, Gulp JavaScript task runner, JS/JQuery, Sass, and a variety of JQuery plugins.</p>
